## Using Bash

Most users think of **BASH** and think it as a prompt on a commmand line. This is partially true, but of course does not 
capture the whole picture. **BASH** actually has two modes in which it will exectute. Not to be confused with the two modes
running modes of the CPU. 

- *interactive mode   :* Typing a ***BASH*** command into the terminal.  
- *non-interactve mode:* Running a ***BASH script*** ("./script_name").

Think of a ***BASH script*** as essentially just a list of ***BASH*** commmands, that are executed sequentially by the shell.
For the most part that last statement is true. However, *scripts* also support logical statements, loops, variables, 
functions, and much more... Writing *scripts* allows us to automate certain logic to make our life or job breazier.

We'll start with the basics of an interactive shell. Once you are familiar with these you will be able to combine them
to make *scripts*.

### Important!!!
You should familiarize yourselves greatly with the following two commands.

- **man man**
- **man apropos**

To be brief, *man* stands for "manual" and it is the command that will pull up the text manual for many things. Needless to 
say it is quite essential to self-tutoring and becoming a great systems programmer.
(tbh I dont know what apropos comman does :laugh:, however there is a great way to find out![by running it])
